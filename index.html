<p>Welcome to my webpage. I havent always been a student in MIS. I use to attend Thornton Academy but now I am enrolled at the University of maine as a full time student in the Business management program. I am from Saco Maine which is about 2 and a half hours south of Orono. I moved to saco when I was 8 years old and have lived there ever since. I have played sports all of my life starting with football and basketball when I was in middle school, soon after I started lacrosse my freshman year I decided to stick with it for all four years of high school. I stopped playing football and basketball once I got into high school. My first job that I worked at was at Funtown in Saco and I prepared food for a small restaurant inside the amusement park called the Hungry Bear. After one summer of working there I decided to leave and work at my local dairy queen. The reason I wanted to work at DQ was because my brother and three cousins all worked there too.</p>
